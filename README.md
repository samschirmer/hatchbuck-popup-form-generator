# hatchbuck-popup-form-generator
This script parses the code from a Hatchbuck form and uses it to generate a popup form. It will ignore any input fields that are not first name, last name, email address, or one of the required, hidden fields. 

To use the generated code, paste the entire code block just before the closing </body> tag of a website.
